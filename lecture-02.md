###The Brain Vs Computational Devices

---

A lot of algorithms have been inspired by biological neural networks.

###About the Brain

---

Hans Movarec in early 90s:
- How much storage & processing. 
- Some devices can move a lot of data but do not store any of the data.
- Other devices have static storage.

He took computers and organisms & put them on the same scale. Hans tried to normalise **animals** to **computers**. He observed the retina of organisms, using algorithms that he believed calculated recognition.

- Lipids
- Fats
- Protein
- Sugars


The brain makes wires with tiny tubes of fat. Inside these tubes is salt water. The tubes are extremely thin -> these facilitate the transmission of signals.

**GOLGI STAIN** *Stain that causes neurons to become either completely stained black or not at all. The stain dyes a fraction of the neurons.*

An **axon** is a really long neuron. Its job is to transmit information to different neurons.

**GAP JUNCTION** *Is a mechanical and electrically conductive link between two neurons. Little packets of chemicals fuse with the wall between the neurons and diffuses. Receptors attach and current can flow.*

At the axon hillock of a typical neuron, the resting potential is around -70 millivolts and the threshold is around -55 millivolts.

Axons have **amplifiers** that aid the transmission of nerve impulses (these are blue in the diagram provided in the lecture slides). An issue surrounding amplifiers is that it may be too weak or too strong. Because of this the amplifiers need to output a strong signal - max. voltage (saturated). All it can transmit is a `1` or a `0`. This is known as a square wave.

**Square Wave** *a non-sinusoidal periodic waveform in which the amplitude alternates at a steady frequency between minimum and maximum values, with the same duration at the minimum and maximum.*

Satellites transmit information similar to how the brain does. A satellite will transmit pulses - short and strong. Lots of information is sent per spike.

When an axon gets thick enough it will grow a **node of Ranvier**.

*The action potential travels from one location in the cell to another, but ion flow across the membrane occurs only in the nodes of Ranvier. The action potential signal jumps along the axon, from node to node, rather than propagating smoothly, as they do in the axons that lack a myelin sheath.*

This is a process by which neurons can be distinguished from another. Experiments were first conducted on mice. Each neuron gets a barcode in accordance with different coloured dyes. The colour extends the entire length of the neuron, meaning that a wiring diargram may be created through colour matching. This is a gene sequencing technique.
